AI Prompts Used for Mock Data Generation

To simulate realistic backend behavior for our project and support frontend development and testing, we used AI to generate mock data for several core functions. These functions include:

- fetchDashboardData
- fetchRecentAlerts
- fetchNetworkData
- fetchVulnerabilities
- scanTarget

Prompt used:
"Develop mock data for backend functions with the following function signatures: fetchDashboardData, fetchRecentAlerts, fetchNetworkData, fetchVulnerabilities, scanTarget. Ensure the data resembles real-world scenarios with plausible values, time formats, and security-relevant content."

Overview of Generated Mock Data:

1. fetchDashboardData:
   Returns system-wide metrics such as total alerts, system health percentages, and scan summaries. Data includes recent activity timestamps and performance indicators.

2. fetchRecentAlerts:
   Provides a list of recent security alerts. Each alert includes severity, timestamp, source IP, and a short description. Useful for testing alert displays and filtering.

3. fetchNetworkData:
   Simulates connected devices on the network. Includes device IPs, MAC addresses, OS types, and status. Helps test visual network layouts and interactivity.

4. fetchVulnerabilities:
   Contains known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE IDs), severity scores, affected systems, and mitigation advice. Enables building and testing vulnerability management UIs.

5. scanTarget:
   Simulates the output of a network scan. Returns open ports, detected services, and basic risk assessment data, imitating a real scan result.

Using AI-generated mock data allowed us to build and test frontend components with realistic and meaningful values before actual backend integration was completed.
