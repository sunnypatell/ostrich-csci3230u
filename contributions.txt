    * Created the vulnerability scanner backend integration with security tools.
    * Implemented the dashboard with all interactive D3.js charts and real-time data visualization.
    * Designed the responsive UI layout and component structure.
    * Set up the database schema and query optimization.
    * Integrated the OSINT collection module with fetch sample data API's.

Royce Mathew
   * Initialized frontend project architecture with Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive design.
   * Created backend mock APIs to simulate real-time data for D3.js visualizations during early development and testing.
   * Customized and styled Shadcn prebuilt components to build a cohesive, user-friendly interactive web interface.
   * Implemented dynamic UI state handling using React hooks and context to support real-time interactivity and data updates.
   * Contributed to cross-component communication patterns to enhance modularity and maintainability of the frontend codebase.
   * Worked with backend to define API and ensure seamless integration.
   * Performed frontend debugging and optimizations to improve load times, interactivity, and responsiveness across devices.

Alyesha Singh
   * Assisted in debugging both frontend and backend issues throughout development, including resolving asynchronous data handling errors.
   * Contributed to the frontend by building and styling reusable UI components using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.
   * Helped set up route management using React Router and optimized navigation for better UX.
   * Worked on backend endpoints related to user settings and preferences using Next.js.
   * Conducted extensive manual testing and participated in code reviews to ensure stability and maintainability.
   * Helped implement loading states, error boundaries, and conditional rendering for a smoother user experience

Michael Ispahani
   * Developed helper utilities for the backend to streamline data formatting, logging, and error handling.
   * Implemented part of the OSINT collection module’s logic and worked with API integration for threat intelligence data.
   * Assisted in designing responsive layouts and improving mobile usability of dashboard pages.
   * Collaborated closely with others to ensure consistent design system implementation across pages.
   * Contributed to deployment scripts and environment configuration setup for testing and production builds.
   * Helped fix CORS issues and refined API communication between the frontend and backend during development.

Freza Majithia
   * Took lead on testing and quality assurance — wrote unit tests using Jest and integration tests with Postman.
   * Helped optimize backend performance by profiling slow queries and refining SQL joins.
   * Co-developed the vulnerability scan result parser and connected it to the visualization dashboard.
   * Built several utility React components used across the dashboard (e.g., modals, tooltips, and form inputs).
   * Collaborated in team standups to triage bugs and assign fixes efficiently.
   * Worked to troubleshoot WebSocket-based real-time updates and ensure smooth data streaming.
